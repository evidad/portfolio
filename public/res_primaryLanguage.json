      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Errol Vidad a Navy Veteran with a background in Mathematics. While in the Navy, I planned operations to hunt submarines, I oversaw maintenace plans for an engineering plant, and I taught trigonmetry and it's application to Navy tactics. After nearly a decade of active service, I separated and began work as a systems analyst for a Navy website. I was responsible for collecting and understanding customer requirements, I developed documentation, and I provided training on website best practices. Eventually, I decided I wanted to be more involved in tech especially the development side so I left my job to pursue an education in software development. I enrolled and recently completed a 6-month coding bootcamp and now I'm proficient in full-stack application development using Python and JavaScript. I'm currently seeking employment and I'm looking for opportunities with a defense tech company so I can combine my military background and software development skills to help positively impact military or federal organizations.",
