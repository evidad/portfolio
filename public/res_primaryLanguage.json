      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Errol Vidad a Software Developer and Navy Veteran with a degree in Mathematics and an active TS/SCI clearance. While in the Navy, I planned operations to hunt submarines, I oversaw operations for an engineering plant, and I taught trigonometry and its application to Navy tactics. As a civilian, I was a systems analyst responsible for balancing customer requirements with software development development plans to improve technical processes. This eventually sparked my interest in software development and led me to enroll in a 6-month coding bootcamp to learn Python and JavaScript. I'm currently seeking employment and I'm looking for opportunities within a defense tech company so I can leverage my military background and software development skills to positively impact defense-related software projects.",
